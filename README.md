The project doesn't work.  I spent well over 40 hours on it.  It's 
supposed to be a store with a console app for entering data manually 
and running reports and an API that could be used to enter data via JSON.

Features:
1) It has an API
2) API methods are asynchronous
3) ProductBrandDTO class uses a SQL query

Instructions:
1) Build the database from migrations files
   using the NuGet Package Manager, run the
   "Update-Database" command.
2) You can set the solution to run startup
   both the console app and the API, or you
   can run them individually.
